# Algorithms-project

This project aims to explore and compare two
algorithmic approaches—Dynamic Programming
and the Greedy Approach—by solving the
”Maximum Interval Scheduling Problem.” This
problem involves selecting the maximum number
of non-overlapping intervals from a given set of
intervals. By implementing both approaches, the
project will evaluate their efficiency and suitability
for solving this problem, offering insights into
their computational trade-offs
